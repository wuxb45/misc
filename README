I'll contains some useful scripts & tools.

here is Introductions for those things.

xit
--------
"Cross it!"
It's a bash script for build cross-compiler tool-chain automatically.
buildroot is too big, and however I need a script. so here comes the
single-file script for a crosstool.
It has been tested with mmix:
  # ./xit mmix /home/wuxb/program/mmix-crosstools
I recommand use '$HOME/program', because you don't have to be root.
'/usr/local' sucks.
